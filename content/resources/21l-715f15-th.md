  caption: Jana Dambrogio holds a model of a highly secure locked letter; one used
    by Queen Elizabeth I of England, her spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, and poet
    John Donne in the 16th-century. Dambrogio reverse-engineers historic originals
    to figure out how they once folded and secured shut to become their own envelopes.
    Students participated in a letterlocking workshop led by Dambrogio on session
    12. (Image courtesy of Jana Dambrogio and Sarah Manguso. Used with permission.)

    paper piercing through it to form a locked letter. The paper lock reads: This
    is a paper lock, now a papered seal with signet impression. The sealing wax acts
    as an adhesive.'
